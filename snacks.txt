Hi everybody here is my favorite snack that i would love to have it on a daily basis, If I have been offered thats French Fries.

There is a very simple way to cook them , You just need to go to near by store and have to buy a french fries which are ready to cook
and after getting home. take them out and fry them in oil till the fries color changes to light orange color . and remove them and add some salt on top of them. That's it your hot french fries are ready to eat.
